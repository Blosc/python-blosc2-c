What is it?
===========

Blosc2 is a high performance data container optimized for binary data.
It builds on the shoulders of Blosc, the high performance
meta-compressor (http://www.blosc.org).

Blosc2 expands the capabilities of Blosc by providing a higher lever
container that is able to store many chunks on it (hence the
super-block name).  Also, it will add more compressors and filters
(e.g. a new delta filter is here already).
